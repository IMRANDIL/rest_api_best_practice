Architecture....


Here we'll be using Express.js for our API. working on 3 layer......

1...Router....

2...Controller....

3...Service layer....


4...Data Access Layer...


Inside the Controller we'll be handling all stuff that is related to HTTP. That means we're dealing with requests and responses for our endpoints. Above that layer is also a little Router from Express that passes requests to the corresponding controller....


//The whole buiness logic will be in the service layer that exports certain services(methods) which are used by the controller...



//The third layer is the Data Access Layer where we'll be working with our Database...We'll be exporting some methods for certain database operations like creating WOD that can be used by our Service Layer...






//Versioning......

//Wait a second, Before we  write any API-specific code we should be aware of versioning. LIke in other applications there will be improvements, new features, and stuff like that. So it is important to version our API as well...



//The big advantage is that we can work on new features or improvements on a new Version while the clients are still using the current version and are affected by breaking changes...



//One good practice is tot add a path segment like  v1 or v2 into the URL....


//Version 1....

/api/v1/workouts


//version 2....

/api/v2/workouts...



//That's what we expose to the outside world and what can be consumed by other developers. But we also need to structure our  project in order to differentiaate between each version...


//There are many different approaches to handling versioning inside an express API. In our case I'd like to create a sub folder for each version inside our src directory called v1....



//Name Resources in Plural.....


After setting it all up we can now dive into the real implementation of our API...LIke I said, I'd like to start with our fundaamental CRUD endpoints...



//In other words, let's start implementing endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting workoouts...



//First, let's hook up a specific controller, service, aand router for our workouts...




//we could name the cretion endpoint /api/v1/workout because we'd like to add one workout, right?...


Basically there's nothing wrong with that approach but this can lead to misunderstandings...



//Always remember...Your API is used by other humans and should be precise....this goes also for naming your resources...



//box is a collection that stores different workouts...



//Naming your resources in plural has the big advantage thaat it's crystal cleaar to other humans, that is a collection that consists of different workouts...






//So, let's define our endpoints inside our workout router....
